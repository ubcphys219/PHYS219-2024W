    "Below, we have provided a more compact version of the code you used last week to examine your data and then do some averaging to pack it. Once you have saved a set of data from the oscilloscope, and uploaded it to your Jupyter account, the entire code runs in one cell. You will probably need to run it several times until you are satisfied with the final output. The key pieces of code that you will need to alter are indicated by notes in Red, and include:\n",
    "- the name for your uploaded raw data file `fname`\n",
    "- the filename you will use to save your packed and trimmed data `output_name`\n",
    "- the zoomed in flat range you use to examine the noise and measure the standard deviation `indexraw_min` to `indexraw_max`\n",
    "- the corresponding y-range for the selected region to examine `yregion_min` to `yregion_max`\n",
    "- (optional) change the way uncertainty is determined from `default` (uses standard deviation of selected region) to `digital` if only occasional bit noise between 2 values appears in the selected region (uses $\\frac{max-min}{\\sqrt{3}}$), or `manual` and provide a value for `manualsigma` (to use a different, justified value or expression for the uncertainty)\n",
    "- the number of points you want to average when packing the data `npac`\n",
    "- to trim unwanted data set the flag `trim` to `1`, and enter `trim_min` and `trim_max` limits of the PACKED indices to include this data only; note if `trim` is set to `0` the full data set will be packed and saved"
