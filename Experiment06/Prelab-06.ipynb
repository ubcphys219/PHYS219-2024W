    "Because this can be such a useful thing to visualize, oscilloscopes usually have this function (to plot one channel vs. another) built in. Indeed our tablet scopes have this as well in the pulldown menu options, and here is what a diode response looks like (this is a Ge diode, with a threshold voltage ~0.3V)! There is no phase shift, so no loop, but we can trace out Vin vs. Vout pretty clearly and easily this way (but no, it won't save this plot directly, you need to still save CH1 and CH2 vs. time and then plot them like we did above). \n",
